# Python Projects Repository

Welcome to **Python Projects Repository**, a curated collection of multiple large-scale projects consolidated here due to their complexity and scope. This repo includes:

1. **Simple Calculator**: A command-line calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
2. **Guess the Number Game**: A number-guessing game for fun.

## Structure
- **Calculator**: `python-projects-repo/calculator/main.py`
- **Game**: `python-projects-repo/guess_the_number_game/main.py`

For detailed documentation of each project, visit [Projects Index](./projects).

## Quick Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhiraj-mishra/python-projects.git
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Per project or aggregate as needed.
```

## Usage

### Calculator
```python
# Run the calculator script with example:
python calculator/main.py --help
```

### Game

python guess_the_number/main.py
```

_Note:_ Replace commands if using a unified setup.

## Dependencies
- **Calculator**: `flask` (if web-based components are used)
- **Game**: Standard Python packages.
